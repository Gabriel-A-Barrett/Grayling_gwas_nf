# Arctic Grayling Landscape Genomics

nextflow pipeline for reproducing analysis done under Arctic Grayling

## Background

In an effort to support reproducibility of bioinformatic workflows and simply make re-running code easier in the event a more samples come in, 
I strung together the Arctic grayling landscape genomics analysis into NextFlow. This NextFlow pipeline will improve 
analysis interpretation through presentation of raw code and order of processes. 

## Usage


## ToDo

    1. ensure bwa_stats channel works for variant_calling
    2. does channel environment split processes and work in variable calls
    3. vcfToEnv process script needs to be reviewed for proper
    4. add LEA and BayPass processes
